The workshop has helped me gain a better understanding of multi-threading, which divides the work of program to multiple threads so it runs faster and more efficiently. In the case of the workshop, the work load of the converter function has been divided into four so multiple threads can work with it simultaneously. This method will utilize more part of the CPU which reduces the response and idle time.
Binary files enable the manipulation of data without the need of character conversion or extraction. It becomes especially helpful when a large ammount of characters are involved, like this workshop.
Binding can create wrappers for functions, calling the wrapper essentially calls the function. It is useful when a function is being called repeated without much changes to its parameters, if changes do need to be made placeholders can be used to change the position and values that the function uses. In the workshop, "auto simple = bind(converter, text, key, nbytes, Cryptor());" was used to reduce the clutter and make the code easier to decipher.
Multi-threading can increase the performance of the program. Most CPU have multiple threads that can be used, using only a single thread is inefficient considering that the other threads are usually going to be left unused and wasted. Although the task in this workshop can be completed with a single thread, in the future when a program needs to have multiple concurrent functions running, multi-thread will become a necessity.
